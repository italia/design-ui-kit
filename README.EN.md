# UI Kit

<img src="INSTRUCTIONS/UI KIT IMG.png" width="800"> 

The UI Kit is part of a set of shared tools, the [design kits](https://designers.italia.it/kit/), which are used to design and implement digital services for citizens. It is available as a Sketch file [*italia UI Kit 2.0.sketch*](https://github.com/italia/design-ui-kit/blob/master/italia UI Kit 2.0.sketch) that you can use with the "add as a library" function in Stech, or even by importing it into Figma by dragging the Sketch file onto the main screen.

The UI Kit is a library of styles (colors, typography, grids) and components (buttons, input fields, menus etc) useful for building prototypes of websites and applications. It was built following the [Guidelines for the design of public administration websites](https://docs.italia.it/italia/designers-italia/design-linee-guida-docs/it/stabile/).

:eyes: If you want to check all the assets before downloading them, you can browse them:

* on [Invision](https://invis.io/RJFGS2UC3HS)
* on [Sketch Cloud](https://www.sketch.com/s/648c8559-bac6-49c6-88dc-2ef016968fdf)
* on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/bLexfydXWzF6ACxFokgzXs/italia-UI-Kit-2.0?node-id=0%3A1)

:dart: The goal is to improve the user experience of online services of the Italian public administration through the diffusion of a consistent and consistent style.

Based on [an inventory and a roadmap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/183hI6EBJo3EeiEcQPGZIe3hNN7EerTU5Udk6SkrH2OU/edit#gid=0) we first built the component design and then translated them into code by feeding the library [Bootstrap Italia](https://italia.github.io/bootstrap-italia/).
  
:star: In this repo you also find a package for icons in the file [*italia-icons.sketch*](https://github.com/italia/design-ui-kit/blob/master/icons/italia-icons.sketch) or [*download them as SVG*](https://github.com/italia/design-ui-kit/tree/master/icons/italia_icons_svg).

**An example of the use of the UI Kit** is the [prototype of the Italian Municipalities website](https://github.com/italia/design-comuni-prototipi). The layout was created using and adapting the components of the UI Kit to specific cases.

## Getting started

* The kit is a Sketch file, before opening it we suggest you download the following typefaces from Google Font: [Titillium](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web), [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono), and [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora).
* In the repo you find the *italia-UI Kit.schetch* file that includes components and styles in a single file, but if you need only specific components, you can download only the one that interests you from the *Components* folder.
* To open the Kit correctly make sure you have the latest version of Sketch.

To use the UI Kit within your project you can upload it directly as Sketch *library*.
This feature allows you to have collections of symbols that you can use in multiple files. You can also keep your documents up-to-date if the libraries are to be changed.

To learn more, go to [Sketchbook Wiki](https://github.com/italia/design-ui-kit/wiki/Sketch-Libraries)

The kit is an open and constantly evolving project not only for components yet to be implemented but also for the implementation of already downloadable files. We therefore recommend checking periodically if there are any updates to the Kit: existing components are implemented and new ones added. To keep the library updated you will need to download the file again from this repo and overwrite it with the copy you have locally.

**If you don't have Sketch** you can import the file in another prototyping tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com), [Invision Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio ) or [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html), or install [Lunacy](https://icons8.it/lunacy) to use Sketch on Windows.
